    <p>I am a computer vision engineer working with deep learning, classic image processing,
        and optical imaging systems.</p>

    <p>More details about my professional experience and academic background can be found on my
        <a href="{{ linkedin.url }}" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a>.</p>

    <p>I also have a <a href="{{ twitter.url }}" target="_blank">Twitter account</a>. We can connect there as well. But I am not a very active
        user, I admit.</p>

    <p>Recently, I started summarizing the main ideas of the papers I read. A little project
        I'm calling "<a href="{{ cvpapers.url }}" target="_blank">The weekly computer vision takeaway</a>." Take a look if it is something that
        interests you.</p>
